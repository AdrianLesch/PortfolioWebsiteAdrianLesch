# Portfolio Website Adrian Lesch - Project

Hi there, thanks for checking in!

This is my repository for my personal portfolio website. I started it as a ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù project for the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer Career Path. The goal was to connect all the skills I‚Äôve learned so far. This page was created using plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Project Planning:
For project planning, I used Trello and followed the Codecademy list of project tasks. You can see the details here:

As you can see, I covered everything‚Äîfrom wireframing the design (which evolved during the creation process) to creating icons, finding images, and adding content. Finally, I styled it using CSS.

## JavaScript Integration:
I set specific goals to integrate various JS scripts, including a collapsing navbar, a counter, and dropdown menus.

## Optimization:
After completing these steps, I focused on optimizing my website. I made it more responsive and suitable for smaller screens by adding ARIA roles and creating a style guide.

I‚Äôm quite proud of what I‚Äôve achieved on my own, although I did seek help and advice from Google, Stack Overflow, and Copilot (especially for creating my project images).

Feel free to explore, and feedback is always appreciated! üòäüëç

Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
